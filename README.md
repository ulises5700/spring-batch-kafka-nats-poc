## 🌟 Features

- **High Performance**: Processes transactions with ultra-low latency.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses Kafka and NATS for real-time updates and notifications.
- **Fraud Detection**: Real-time fraud checks to ensure transaction integrity.
- **Stable Financial Processing**: Designed for durable financial batch processing.

## 🔍 How It Works

This application utilizes a Hybrid Event-Driven Architecture. It combines both hot and cold paths for data processing. The hot path processes events rapidly, while the cold path handles batch jobs, ensuring data is processed without delay during peak loads.

Kafka serves as the backbone for managing events and messages between services. NATS provides lightweight messaging to support service communication. This architecture is essential for high-performance applications, especially in the fintech sector.
